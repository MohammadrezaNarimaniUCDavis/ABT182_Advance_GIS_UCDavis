# Week 5 Demo – GeoPandas with USA Data

This demo mirrors **Lab 5 (GeoPandas)** but uses **USA states** instead of California counties. Same structure and difficulty: read shapefile, reproject, area, stats, queries, plots, attribute join with CSV, and a mapping function.

## Contents

- **Demo_Lab5_ABT182_USA.ipynb** – Demo notebook (run from this `Demo` folder).
- **Data/** – Put the USA states shapefile and state-level CSV here. See **Data/DATA_SOURCES.md** for download links.
- **Images/** – Figures saved by the notebook (Step1_StatesMap.png, Step2_AreaChoropleth.png, etc.) for use on the Week 5 website.

## How to run

1. Download the data (see `Data/DATA_SOURCES.md`) and place files in `Data/`.
2. Open the notebook; set your working directory to this `Week5/Demo` folder (or set `DATA_DIR` / `IMAGES_DIR` in the first code cell).
3. Run all cells. Images will be written to `Images/`.
